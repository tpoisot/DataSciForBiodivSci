# Introduction

This book started as a collection of notes from several classes I gave in the Department of Biological Sciences at the Université de Montréal, as well as a few workshops I ran with the Québec Centre for Biodiversity Sciences. In teaching data synthesis, data science, and machine learning to biology students, I realized that the field was missing a stepping stone to proficiency. There are excellent manuals covering the mathematics of data science and machine learning **REFS**; there are many good papers giving overviews of some applications of data science to biological problems **REFS**; and there are, of course, thousands of tutorials about how to write code. But one thing that students commonly called for was an attempt to tie concepts together. This is this attempt.
