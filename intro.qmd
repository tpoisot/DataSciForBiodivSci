# Introduction

Data science is now an established methodology to study biodiversity, and this is a problem. Well, this is an opportunity when it comes to advancing our knowledge of biodiversity [@tuia2022], but this is a problem for us, biodiversity scientists, as we suddenly need to develop competences in an entirely new field. And as luck would have it, there are easier fields to master than data science.

But what do we mean by *data science*? Most science, after all, relies on data in some capacity. What falls under the umbrella of data science is, in short, embracing in equal measure quantitative skills (mathematics, machine learning, statistics), programming, and domain expertise, in order to solve well-defined problems. A core tenet of data science is that, when using it, we seek to "deliver actionable insights", which is MBA-speak for "figuring out what to do next". One of the ways in which this occurs is by letting the data speak, after they have been, of course, properly cleaned and transformed and engineered beyond recognition.

Before we embark into a journey of discovery on the applications of data science to biodiversity, allow me to let you in on a little secret. Data *science* is a little bit of a misnomer. Science is (or so we like to say) neutral, systematic, and rigorous. Science is baking. Data science? It's cooking. There might be a recipe, but it's a recommendation at best,and after all you know better than to follow a list of instructions, don't you? Data science is craft. It's art. Data vibes.
