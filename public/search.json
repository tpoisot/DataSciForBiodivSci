    "text": "Preface\nData science is now an established methodology to study biodiversity, and this is a problem.\nThis may be an opportunity when it comes to advancing our knowledge of biodiversity, and in particular when it comes to translating this knowledge into action (Tuia et al. 2022); but make no mistake, this is a problem for us, biodiversity scientists, as we suddenly need to develop competences in an entirely new field. And as luck would have it, there are easier fields to master than data science. The point of this book, therefore, is to provide an introduction to fundamental concepts in data science, from the perspective of a biodiversity scientist, by using examples corresponding to real-world use-cases of these techniques.\nBut what do we mean by data science? Most science, after all, relies on data in some capacity. What falls under the umbrella of data science is, in short, embracing in equal measure quantitative skills (mathematics, machine learning, statistics), programming, and domain expertise, in order to solve well-defined problems. A core tenet of data science is that, when using it, we seek to “deliver actionable insights”, which is MBA-speak for “figuring out what to do next”. One of the ways in which this occurs is by letting the data speak, after they have been, of course, properly cleaned and transformed and engineered beyond recognition. This entire process is driven by (or subject to, even) domain knowledge. There is no such thing as data science, at least not in a vacuum: there is data science as a methodology applied to a specific domain.\nBefore we embark into a journey of discovery on the applications of data science to biodiversity, allow me to let you in on a little secret: data science is a little bit of a misnomer.\nTo understand why, it helps to think of science (the application of the scientific method, that is) as cooking. There are general techniques one must master, and specific steps and cultural specifics, and there is a final product. When writing this preface, I turned to my shelf of cookbooks, and picked my two favorites: Robuchon’s The Complete Robuchon (a no-nonsense list of hundreds of recipes with no place for improvisation), and Bianco’s Pizza, Pasta, and Other Food I Like (a short volume with very few pizza and pasta, and wonderful discussions about the importance of humility, creativity, and generosity). Data science, if it were cooking, would feel a lot like the second. Deviation from the rules (they are mostly recommendations, in fact) is often justifiable if you feel like it. But this improvisation requires good skills, a clear mental map of the problem, and a library of patterns that you can draw from.\nThis book will not get you here. But it will speed up the process, by framing the practice of data science as a natural way to conduct research on biodiversity.\n\n\n\n\nTuia, Devis, Benjamin Kellenberger, Sara Beery, Blair R.

    "section": "2.1 A digression: which birds are red?",
    "text": "2.1 A digression: which birds are red?\nBefore diving in, it is a good idea to ponder a simple case. We can divide everything in just two categories: things with red feathers, and things without red feathers. An example of a thing with red feathers is the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), and things without red feathers are the iMac G3, Haydn’s string quartets, and of course the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis).\nSee, biodiversity data science is complicated, because it tends to rely on the assumption that we can categorize the natural world, and the natural world (mostly in response to natural selection) comes up with ways to be, well, diverse. In the Northern Cardinal, this is shown in males having red feathers, and females having mostly brown feathers. Before moving forward, we need to consider ways to solve this issue, as this issue will come up all the time.\nThe first mistake we have made is that the scope of objects we want to classify, which we will describe as the “domain” of our classification, is much too broad: there are few legitimate applications where we will have a dataset with Northern Cardinals, iMac G3s, and Haydn’s string quartets. Picking a reasonable universe of classes would have solved our problem a little. For example, among the things that do not have red feathers are the Mourning Dove, the Kentucky Warbler, and the House Sparrow.\nThe second mistake that we have made is improperly defining our classes; bird species exhibit sexual dimorphism (not in an interesting way, like wrasses, but you let’s still give them some credit for trying). Assuming that there is such a thing as a Northern Cardinal is not necessarily a reasonable assumption! And yet, the assumption that a single label is a valid representation of non-monomorphic populations is a surprisingly common one, with actual consequences for the performance of image classification algorithms (Luccioni and Rolnick 2023). This assumption reveals a lot about our biases: male specimens are over-represented in museum collections, for example (Cooper et al. 2019). In a lot of species, we would need to split the taxonomic unit into multiple groups in order to adequately describe them.\nThe third mistake we have made is using predictors that are too vague. The “presence of red feathers” is not a predictor that can easily discriminate between the Northen Cardinal (yes for males, sometimes for females), the House Finch (a little for males, no for females), and the Red-Winged Black Bird (a little for males, no for females). In fact, it cannot really capture the difference between red feathers for the male House Finch (head and breast) and the male Red Winged Black Bird (wings, as the name suggests).\nThe final mistake we have made is in assuming that “red” is relevant as a predictor. In a wonderful paper, Cooney et al. (2022) have converted the color of birds into a bird-relevant colorimetric space, revealing a clear latitudinal trend in the ways bird colors, as perceived by other birds, are distributed. This analysis, incidentally, splits all species into males and females. The use of a color space that accounts for the way colors are perceived is a fantastic example of why data science puts domain knowledge front and center.\nDeciding which variables are going to be accounted for, how the labels will be defined, and what is considered to be within or outside the scope of the classification problem is difficult. It requires domain knowledge (you must know a few things about birds in order to establish criteria to classify birds), and knowledge of how the classification methods operate (in order to have just the right amount of overlap between features in order to provide meaningful estimates of distance)."

    "section": "2.2 The problem: classifying pixels from an image",
    "text": "2.2 The problem: classifying pixels from an image\nThroughout this chapter, we will work on a single image – we may initially balk at the idea that an image is data, but it is! Specifically, an image is a series of instances (the pixels), each described by their position in a multidimensional colorimetric space. Greyscale images have one dimension, and images in color will have three: their red, green, and blue channels. Not only are images data, this specific dataset is going to be far larger than many of the datasets we will work on in practice: the number of pixels we work with is given by the product of the width and height of the image!\nIn fact, we are going to use an image with a lot more dimensions: the data in this chapter are coming from a Landsat 9 image Vermote et al. (2016), for which we have access to 7 different bands (the full data product has more bands, but we will not use them all.\n\n\n\nBand number\nInformation\n\n\n\n\n1\nAerosol\n\n\n2\nVisible blue\n\n\n3\nVisible red\n\n\n4\nVisible green\n\n\n5\nNear-infrared (NIR)\n\n\n6\nShort wavelength IR (SWIR 1)\n\n\n7\nSWIR 2\n\n\n\nFrom these channels, we can reconstruct an approximation of what the landscape looked like (by using the red, green, and blue channels) – this information is presented in Figure 2.1 . Or is it? If we were to invent a time machine, and go stand directly under Landsat 9 at the exact center of this scene, and look around, what would we see? We would see colors, and they would admit a representation as a three-dimensional vector of red, green, and blue. But we would see so much more than that! And even if we were to stand within a pixel, we would see a lot of colors. And texture. And depth. We would see something entirely different from this map; and we would be able to draw a lot more inferences about our surroundings than what is possible by knowing the average color of a 30x30 meters pixel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The Landsat 9 data are combined into the “Natural Color” image, in which the red, green, and blue bands are mapped to their respective channels. This looks eerily like the way we perceive the landscape. Note how little difference there is between the large body of water and the surrounding crops. This emphasizes that the combination of channels we use will limit our ability to separate the pixels into groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut just like we can get more information that Landsat 9, so to can Landsat 9 out-sense us when it comes to getting information. In the same way that we can extract a natural color composite out of the different channels, we can extract a fake color one to highlight differences in the landscape; in Figure 2.2, we show such a fake color composite, that is particularly efficient at drawing our attention to the location of water in this area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: The same landscape as above is now presented in a fake color composite, where SWIR is mapped to the red channel, NIR to the green channel, and red to the blue channel. This highlights different values in the landscape, but is no more or less “real” than the true color composite. It is a visualization of the data, that represents different choices, questions, and assumptions. Compared to the Natural Color composite, this version of the data highlights the water, areas with vegetation, and more arid areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Figure 2.2 and Figure 2.1 represent the same physical place at the same moment in time; but through them, we are looking at this place with very different purposes. This is not an idle observation, but a core notion in data science: what we measure defines what we can see. In order to tell something meaningful about this place, we need to look at it in the “right” way.\nSo far, we have looked at this area by combining the raw data. Depending on the question we have in mind, they may not be the right data. In fact, they may not hold information that is relevant to our question at all; or worse, they can hold more noise than signal. Looking at Figure 2.1, we might wonder, “where are the fields?”. And based on our knowledge of what plants do, we can start thinking about this question in a different way. Specifically, “is there a series of features of fields that are not shared by non-fields?”. But this a complicated question to answer, and so we can simplify this by asking, “how can I combine data from the image to know if there is a plant?”.\nOne way to do this is to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index, or NDVI (Kennedy and Burbach 2020). NDVI is derived from the band data (we will see how in a minute), and is an adequate heuristic to make a difference between vegetation, barren soil, and water. Because we are specifically thinking about fields, we can also consider the NDWI (water) and NDMI (moisture) dimensions: taken together, these information will represent every pixel in a three-dimensional space, telling us whether there are plants (NDVI), whether they are stressed (NDMI), and whether this pixel is a water body (NDWI).\nBecause there are a few guidelines (educated guesses, in truth, and the jury is still out on the “educated” part) about the values, we can look at the relationship between the NDVI and NDMI data Figure 2.3. For example, NDMI values around -0.1 (note how there is a strong cluster of points here) are low-canopy cover with low water stress; NDVI values from 0.2 to 0.5 are good candidates for moderately dense crops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: The pixels acquired from Landsat 8 exist in a space with many different dimensions (one for each band). Because we are interested in a landscape classification based on water/vegetation data, we use the NDVI, NDMI, and NDWI combinations of bands. These are derived data, and represent an instance of feature engineering: we have derived these values from the raw data.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy picking these three values, instead of simply looking at the clustering of all the bands in the raw data, we are starting to refine what the algorithm see, through the lens of what we know is important about the system."

As a method for unsupervised clustering, k-means will return a vector of class memberships, which is to say, a list that maps each observation (pixel, in our case) to a class (tentatively, a cohesive landscape unit). What this means is that k-means is a transformation, taking as its input a vector with three dimensions (red, green, blue), and returning a scalar (an integer, even!), giving the class to which this pixel belongs. These are the input and output of our blackbox, and now we can start figuring out its internals.\n\n2.3.1 Overview of the algorithms"

    "text": "3.2 The problem: how many interactions in a food web?\nOne of the earliest observation that ecologists made about food webs is that when there are more species, there are more interactions. A remarkably insightful crowd, food web ecologists. Nevertheless, it turns out that this apparently simple question had received a few different answers over the years. In\nThe initial model was proposed by Cohen and Briand (1984): the number of interactions \\(L\\) scales linearly with the number of species \\(S\\). After all, we can assume that when averaging over many consumers, there will be an average diversity of resources they consume, and so the number of interactions could be expressed as \\(L \\approx b\\times S\\).\nNot so fast, said Martinez (1992). When we start looking a food webs with more species, the increase of \\(L\\) with regards to \\(S\\) is superlinear. Thinking in ecological terms, maybe we can argue that consumers are flexible, and that instead of sampling a set number of resources, they will sample a set proportion of the number of consumer-resource combinations (of which there are \\(S^2\\)). In this interpretation, \\(L \\approx b\\times S^2\\).\nBut the square term can be relaxed; and there is no reason not to assume a power law, with \\(L\\approx b\\times S^a\\). This last formulation has long been accepted as the most workable one, because it is possible to approximate values of its parameters using other ecological processes (Brose et al. 2004).\nThe “reality” (i.e. the relationship between \\(S\\) and \\(L\\) that correctly accounts for ecological constraints, and fit the data as closely as possible) is a little bit different than this formula (MacDonald, Banville, and Poisot 2020). But for the purpose of this chapter, figuring out the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from empirical data is a very instructive exercise.\n\n\n\n\nBrose, Ulrich, Annette Ostling, Kateri Harrison, and Neo D.

    "text": "4.1 Training\nIn data science (in machine learning in particular), we do fit models. We train them. This is an important difference: training is an iterative process, that we can repeat, optimize, and tweak. The outcome of training and the outcome of fitting are essentially the same (a model that is parameterized to work as well as possible on a given dataset), but it is good practice to adopt the language of a field, and the language of data science emphasizes the different practices in model training.\nTraining, to provide a general definition, is the action of modifying the parameters of a model, based on knowledge of the data, and the error that results from using the current parameter values. In Chapter 3, for example, we will see how to train a linear model using the technique of gradient descent. Our focus in this chapter is not on the methods we use for training, but on the data that are required to train a model.\nTraining a model is a process akin to rote learning: we will present the same input, and the same expected responses, many times over, and we will find ways for the error on each response to decrease.\nIn order to initiate this process, we need an untrained model. Untrained, in this context, refers to a model that has not been trained on the specific problem we are addressing; the model may have been trained on a different problem (for example, we want to predict the distribution of a species based on a GLM trained on a phylogenetically related species). It is important to note that by “training the model”, what we really mean is “change the structure of the parameters until the output looks right”. For example, assuming a simple linear model like \\(c(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2\\), training this model would lead to changes in the values of \\(\\beta\\), but not to the consideration of a new model \\(c(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\beta_3X_1X_2\\). Comparing models is the point of validation, which we will address later on.\nneed for instances\nneed for responses"
