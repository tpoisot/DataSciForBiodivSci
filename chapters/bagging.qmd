# Bagging, ensembles, and uncertainty {#sec-bagging}

In @sec-tuning, we have established a good (as evaluated on the testing data) model for the distribution of *Sitta whiteheadi*. In this chapter, before jumping into the explainability of predictions [@sec-explanations], we will introduce a technique called bootstrap aggregating (or bagging, for short), discuss the notion of ensemble models, and see how we can use these approaches to talk about model uncertainty.

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
_code_path = joinpath(dirname(Base.active_project()), "code")
include(joinpath(_code_path, "pkg.jl"))
include(joinpath(_code_path, "minisdm/pipelines.jl"))
```
