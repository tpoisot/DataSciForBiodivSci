# Supervised classification {#sec-classification}

In the previous chapters, we have focused on efforts on regression models, which is to say models that predict a continuous response. In this chapter, we will introduce the notion of classification, which is the prediction of a discrete variable representing a category. There are a lot of topics we need to cover before we can confidently come up with a model for classification, and so this chapter is part of a series. We will first introduce the idea of classification; in @sec-variable-selection, we will explore techniques to fine-tune the set of variables we use for prediction; in @sec-tuning, we will think about predictions of classes as probabilities, and generalize these ideas and think about learning curves; finally, in @sec-explanations, we will think about variables a lot more, and introduce elements of model interpretability.
