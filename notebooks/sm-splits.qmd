title: An analysis of the sakura phenology dataset
---

This notebook is used to support the chapter on data splitting.

```{julia}
using DataFrames
import CSV
using Statistics
using GLM
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!(; px_per_unit = 2)
```

We first load the data. The data as presented here have a column for the temperature in March, which has been smoothed, and for the day of bloom, which is expressed as day of year:

```{julia}
sakura = DataFrame(CSV.File(joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "data", "general", "sakura.csv")))
allowmissing!(sakura, :temperature)
replace!(sakura.temperature, -50.0 => missing)
sort!(sakura, :year)
describe(sakura)
dropmissing!(sakura)
```

We can inspect the data to look for a linear relationship between temperature and flowering time:

```{julia}
scatter(sakura.temperature, sakura.flowering)
```

Because the raw observations are noisy, we calculate a 20 years running average of the day of bloom:

```{julia}
average = zeros(Float64, size(sakura, 1))
for (i, row) in enumerate(eachrow(sakura))
    year_span = row.year .+ (-10, 10)
    valid_records = year_span[1] .< sakura.year .< year_span[2]
    subset = sakura[findall(valid_records), :]
    average[i] = mean(subset.flowering)
end
sakura.flowavg = average
```

We can now define a few loss functions to compare them later on:

```{julia}
mse(tr, pr) = mean((tr .- pr).^2.0)
rmse(tr, pr) = sqrt(mse(tr, pr))
mae(tr, pr) = mean(abs.(tr .- pr))
mbe(tr, pr) = mean(tr .- pr)
```

We now define a series of folds, in order to do k-folds cross validation. Note that we keep a holdout test dataset corresponding to the end of the time series for model evaluation.

```{julia}
n = size(sakura, 1)
test_size = ceil.(Int, 0.1n)

sakuratrain = sakura[1:(n-test_size), :]
sakuratest = sakura[(n-test_size+1):n, :]

folds = ceil.(Int, LinRange(1, size(sakuratrain, 1), 11))
```

This next figure is purely an illustration of the splits:

```{julia}
#| label: fig-split-illustration
#| fig-cap: An illustration of a series of folds on a timeseries. The grey aata are used for training, the black data for validation, and the red data are kept for testing. Note that in this context, we sometimes use the future to validate on the past (look at the first fold!), but this is acceptable for reasons explained in the text.
f = Figure()
s1 = Axis(f[1,1])
s2 = Axis(f[2,1])
s3 = Axis(f[3,1])
s4 = Axis(f[4,1])
for (i,s) in enumerate([s1, s2, s3, s4])
    lines!(s, sakuratrain.year, sakuratrain.flowavg, color=:lightgrey)
    lines!(s, sakuratest.year, sakuratest.flowavg, color=:red, linewidth=4)
    j = 2i-1
    valid_idx = folds[j]:folds[j+1]
    train_idx = filter(n -> !(n in valid_idx), 1:size(sakuratrain, 1))
    valid = sakuratrain[valid_idx, :]
    train = sakuratrain[train_idx, :]
    lines!(s, valid.year, valid.flowavg, color=:black, linewidth=2)
    hidedecorations!(s)
    hidespines!(s)
end
current_figure()
```

placeholders for validation measures

```{julia}
train_mse = zeros(Float64, length(folds)-1)
valid_mse = zeros(Float64, length(folds)-1)
train_rmse = zeros(Float64, length(folds)-1)
valid_rmse = zeros(Float64, length(folds)-1)
train_mae = zeros(Float64, length(folds)-1)
valid_mae = zeros(Float64, length(folds)-1)
train_mbe = zeros(Float64, length(folds)-1)
valid_mbe = zeros(Float64, length(folds)-1)
```

this is the cross validation

```{julia}
for (i, Ki) in enumerate(folds)
    if Ki < size(sakuratrain, 1)
        valid_idx = folds[i]:folds[i+1]
        train_idx = filter(n -> !(n in valid_idx), 1:size(sakuratrain, 1))
        valid = sakuratrain[valid_idx, :]
        train = sakuratrain[train_idx, :]
        model = lm(@formula(flowavg ~ temperature), train)
        valid_mse[i] = mse(valid.flowavg, predict(model, valid))
        train_mse[i] = mse(train.flowavg, predict(model, train))
        valid_rmse[i] = rmse(valid.flowavg, predict(model, valid))
        train_rmse[i] = rmse(train.flowavg, predict(model, train))
        valid_mae[i] = mae(valid.flowavg, predict(model, valid))
        train_mae[i] = mae(train.flowavg, predict(model, train))
        valid_mbe[i] = mbe(valid.flowavg, predict(model, valid))
        train_mbe[i] = mbe(train.flowavg, predict(model, train))
    end
end
```

We now train the model on the full dataset

```{julia}
model = lm(@formula(flowavg ~ temperature), sakuratrain)
```

```{julia}
scatter(sakura.year, sakura.flowavg, color=:lightgrey)
lines!(sakuratrain.year, predict(model, sakuratrain), color=:black)
lines!(sakuratest.year, predict(model, sakuratest), color=:red)
current_figure()
```

```{julia}
f = Figure()
ax = Axis(f[1,1]; xgridvisible=false, ygridvisible=false, xlabel="Fold", ylabel="MAE loss")
scatterlines!(ax, train_mae, color=:grey, label="Training data")
scatterlines!(ax, valid_mae, color=:black, label="Validation data")
hlines!(ax, mae(sakuratest.flowavg, predict(model, sakuratest)), color=:red, label="Testing data")
hidespines!(ax, :l, :r, :t, :b)
hidexdecorations!(ax; label=false)
ylims!(ax, (0, 3))
axislegend(ax)
