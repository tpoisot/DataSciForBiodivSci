This book is the supporting material for classes BIO3033 and BIO6033 at
Université de Montréal.

In order to build the material, you need Julia (1.9), Quarto (1.4), a LaTeX
installation, the TeX Gyre math fonts, and this should be it.

Note that for Quarto to reliably build Julia notebooks, you need to install
`IJulia` in the default environment, and *make sure it has been built once*.

The `main` branch only accepts content through pull requests, and the `drafting`
branch is used as a staging area for all incoming changes. A PR from `drafting`
to `main` *must* have a fully rendered document with it.
