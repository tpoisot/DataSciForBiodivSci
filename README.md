This book is the supporting material for classes BIO3033 and BIO6033 at Université de Montréal.

In order to build the material, you need Julia (1.9), Quarto (1.4), a LaTeX installation, the TeX Gyre math fonts, and this should be it.

Note that for Quarto to reliably build Julia notebooks, you need to install `IJulia` in the default environment, and *make sure it has been built once*.
